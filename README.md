Rescued part of an Erlang MVC web-application server created in 2009.
Sadly the full repository is seemingly lost to cyberspace.

The server originally featured a strict Model View Controller architecture.
The web-application server could compile, hotswap and update all modules.

May reprogram the lost modules in the future just for fun.
